### My Goal: [Fundamentals of Computing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/fundamentalscomputing2)
- It consists of 6 courses. 2 Beginner, 2 intermediate, and 2 advanced. I am currently on the 1st advanced one called Algorithmic Thinking Part 1. Below is the syllabus:

Module | Homework | Project | Application
-------|-----------|--------|------------
1    | Graphs and brute-force algorithms | Degree distributions for graphs | Analysis of citation graphs
2    | Algorithmic efficiency and BFS | Connected components and graph resilience |	Analysis of a computer network
3    | Divide and conquer | Closest pairs and clustering algorithms | Comparison of clustering algorithms
4    | Dynamic programming | Alignment of sequences | Applications to genomics and beyond

### TODO for Week 1:
- [ ] Homework: Graphs and brute-force algorithms
- [ ] Project: Degree distributions for graphs
- [ ] Application: Analysis of citation graphs
